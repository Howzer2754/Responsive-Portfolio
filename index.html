                <p>Joseph B. Pak is currently enrolled in the University of Toronto SCS Coding Bootcamp program and hopes to become a full-stack developer once he has completed the program.  Prior to enrollment, Joseph has worked for a manufacturing plant in the capacity of an office administrator and later the plant director between the years of 2013 to 2018.  Joseph has also worked in the computer industry specifically with computer hardware and networking between the years of 2000 to 2013.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Joseph completed his education a little later in life, receiving his Ontario Secondary School Diploma in the year 2011 and majoring in <em>sociology</em> at Ryerson University afterwards.  An interest in human interaction formed due to his studies in sociology and thus lead Joseph to find volunteering opportunities which were directly related to the community.  He continues to volunteer with the community to this day.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Some of Joseph's hobbies include but are not limited to, computer games, science fiction, gym exercise, skiing, cycling, custom computer builds, coding, etc.</p>
